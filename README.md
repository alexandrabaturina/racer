# Intermediate JS Nanodegree Project #3: UdaciRacer Simulator
## Overview
**UdaciRacer Simulator** is the third project of Udacity [Intermediate JavaScript](https://www.udacity.com/course/intermediate-javascript-nanodegree--nd032) nanodegree program. It requires to build a racing game which allows a user to race a simulated racer. This racing game runs as a Node application. 

The goal of the project is to use the provided starter project to build the web interface for:
* Creating Races (the selection of tracks and pod racers)
* Displaying the real-time race updates
* A final score/rankings view

## Features
Players get to choose their racer and the track they want to race on. The strategy of the game is for each player to choose a pod racer they expect to win over a certain race track based on the podâ€™s characteristics (acceleration, handling, and top speed). A pre-built API creates the race selected by the players and returns a stream of information lasting the duration of the race, resulting in a final ranking of racers.
